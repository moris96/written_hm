* Answers: 
    * 1: How does the internet work? 
        * The internet works by using a packet routing network that follows internet protocol (IP) and transport control protocal (TCP). IP & TPC work together to make sure data transmitts across the internet as consistent and reliable as possible no matter which device or web browser that's being used. Application programming interference (API) is an intermediary that allows 2 applications to work together. 
    * 2: What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?
        * HTML: HyperText Markup Language is the code that is used to structure web content like images, divs, buttons, forms, etc... It's the body of the website. 
        * CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is used for styling web pages. It's the clothes of the website. 
        * JavaScript: Allows you to implement complex features on the website making it interactive, but also has other powerful capabilities like server control, APIs, Node JS, etc... It's the brains of the website. 
    * 3: What is the difference between backend and frontend?
        * Front-end: Focuses on visual aspects of the website. CSS & HTML are heavily used on this.
        * Back-end: Focuses on the website's structure, system, data, and logic. 
        * Full-stack: frontend + backend
